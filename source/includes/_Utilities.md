# Utilities

EGF2 provides a set of convenient utilities to be used by service developers. The list is below:

1. `"auth"`, `"client-data"` and `"pusher"` libraries make working with corresponding services easier
* `"event-consumer"` hides details of working with the system event queue
* `"option"` is a simple library that allows a service to be able to obtain config from a URL specified in "-config" start option.
* `"search"` library facilitates work with ElasticSearch by providing an interface that is consistent with API search endpoint.

Utilities reside in "commons" repository.
